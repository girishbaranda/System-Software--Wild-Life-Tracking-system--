System-Software--Wild-Life-Tracking-system--
============================================

Project creaed as a system software project. It tracks the data uploaded by the sensors from different place and updates
the data at the central server..
The prolem statement was as follow:
Design and develop a file system for an embedded system which is used in wild life tracking devices. This device does two things
(1) Store photos taken on specific locations while tracking the object.
(2) Store readings of temperature, humidity, speed, light, time of these readings, etc.
You may use optimal methods to implement
(1) Create, delete, store, retrieve, open, and close as primitive operations.
(2) Send and receive these files on other instance of the same file system.
(3) Use some sort of encryption and decryption algorithm for storing/retrieving of the data.
(4) Parallel access must be implemented in these file systems to make remote machine capable enough to access this file systems.
